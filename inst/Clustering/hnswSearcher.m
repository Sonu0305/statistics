## @deftp {Class} hnswSearcher
##
## Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) nearest neighbor searcher class.
##
## The @code{hnswSearcher} class implements the HNSW algorithm for efficient
## nearest neighbor queries.  It stores training data and supports various
## distance metrics for performing searches.  The HNSW algorithm builds a
## multilayer graph structure that enables fast approximate nearest neighbor
## searches by navigating through the graph.  It facilitates a nearest neighbor
## search using @code{knnsearch} or a radius search using @code{rangesearch}.
##
## You can either use the @code{hnswSearcher} class constructor or the
## @code{createns} function to create an @qcode{hnswSearcher} object.
